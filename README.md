# API SIMULATOR

You can use this repo as boilerplate for authentication Rest API using JWT and JSONServer.

To login on the application just need to make a `POST` request to `/auth/login`. With a valid `username` and `password` which you can find in the root folder filename: `users.json`.

To make a request for the JSONServer just need to add the token generated by JWT and add this as a header with the key `authorization`.

Happy Coding :computer:
